**Unit 5: *Samson Agonistes*** <span id="5"></span> 
I*n this final unit, we will explore another one of Milton’s very last
works, the drama, Samson Agonistes that begins after Samson’s blindness
and imprisonment and tells the story of his final hours. Samson
Agonistes is sometimes called a companion piece to Paradise Regained,
since they have similar themes and they were published at the same time.
As with the* Paradise Regained *unit, we will begin by placing the work
in dialogue with other texts and traditions from which Milton drew. We
will then trace a number of the work’s major concerns and achievements.*

**5.1 Thematic Relationship of Samson Agonistes to Paradise Regained and
to Milton’s Life** <span id="5.1"></span> 
*Guiding Questions:*  

-   *In what way is Samson Agonistes influenced by the Classical
    (Greco-Roman) world and in what way is it influenced by the
    Judeo-Christian world?*  
      
-   *In what way might Samson Agonistes be considered somewhat
    autobiographical for Milton?*  
      
-   *In what way does Samson function as a prophet in this drama?*  
      
-   *In what way might Samson’s three major encounters (Manoa, Dalila,
    and Harapha) be considered temptations analogous to the three
    temptations Jesus encounters in Paradise Regained?*  
      
-   *Does Samson’s character grow and develop throughout the drama or
    does it not? Explain.*  
      
-   *Does Samson triumph as a great political and religious hero in the
    end or is he a mere terrorist? *
