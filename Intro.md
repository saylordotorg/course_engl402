In this course, we will study the poetry of John Milton, focusing not
only on the texts themselves, but also on the various contexts that are
relevant to Milton’s oeuvre, from the tumultuous political and religious
period in which Milton lived to the literary network with which his
texts interact. We will also take a close look at the man behind
*Paradise Lost*, a man who brazenly announced, relatively early in his
poetic career, that he would pen a great epic in the classical
tradition. Who was John Milton, and how did he manage to accomplish this
goal? Though Milton has gone in and out of literary favor since his
death in 1674 (Romantic poets greatly valued his formal techniques as
well as his figuration of Hell, while Modernists like T.S. Eliot scowled
at his bookish, Puritan austerity), there is no question that Milton’s
works shaped the face and the future of English poetry, as well as
contemporary books, film, and culture. By the end of this course, you
will possess a comprehensive understanding of Milton, his times, and his
works.

 **Course Designer**: Jennifer Shoop  
    
 **Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

    [http://oyc.yale.edu](http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-220#sessions)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit will lay the groundwork
for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in
the later units. You will also need to complete  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to prepare adequately for this exam, you will need to
work through the materials in each unit.  
    
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score will be tabulated upon the exam’s
completion. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again following
a 14-day waiting period.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **73.25 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a *time
advisory* that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit. These advisories should help you plan your time
accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to
complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For example,
Unit 1 should take 6.5 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of
3hours) on Monday night; subunits 1.3 and 1.4 (a total of 6.5 hours) on
Tuesday night; etc.
