**Unit 3: *Paradise Lost*** <span id="3"></span> 
*We will now turn to Milton’s most famous work, his epic poem* Paradise
Lost*. The poem addresses the human condition - man’s Fall from grace
and the promise of his restoration. We will first examine the
intertextual nature of the work - its relationship to existing
traditions and works - before progressing through the length of the epic
book-by-book, focusing on particular thematic concerns as they emerge.
Finally, we will take a broader view of the work, considering its formal
and stylistic achievements on the whole.*

**3.2 Paradise Lost** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Guiding Questions:*

-   *According to Book 1’s epic theme, Milton is attempting to “assert
    Eternal Providence, / And justify the ways of God to men (25 - 26).”
    What do you think or feel about that? Should Milton try to do that?
    Why or why not? Is he qualified to do so? Why or why not?*  
      
-   *What is the tone and spirit of Satan’s speeches in Books 1 and 2
    and what does that make you think or feel about him?*  
      
-   *What is the tone and spirit of God the Father’s speeches in Book 3
    and what does that make you think or feel about Him?*  
      
-   *What are some strengths or weaknesses of Raphael as a storyteller
    in Books 5 through 8 and what is his purpose in the stories he
    tells?*  
      
-   *What do you think of Milton’s portrayal of the revolt and war in
    Heaven in Books 5 and 6? Is this grand epic, religious or political
    allegory, farce, satire, or what?*  
      
-   *What is the function of the Creation narrative in the context of
    the “Destruction” narrative of the two previous books? What is the
    purpose of Book 7?*  
      
-   *Analyze Adam and Eve’s relationship as portrayed in Books 4 through
    9. What is the nature of Eve’s personality (is she happy, oppressed,
    passive, activist, or what)?*  
      
-   *In Book 9’s debate between Adam and Eve about working together or
    separately, who is correct? Why?*  
      
-   *What are some of Satan’s strategies and arguments to get Eve to
    sin? If you were Eve, would you have bitten the apple? Why or why
    not?*  
      
-   *What are the consequences of Original Sin upon Adam, Eve, the
    Serpent, Satan and the demons, and on all Creation? Are these
    consequences fair or not? Why?*  
      
-   *In what ways do Adam and Eve seem to change in their relationship
    to each other after the Fall? How might this reflect our own
    experiences more than in their pre-fallen state?*  
      
-   *What is the purpose of Books 11 and 12 and how do they relate to
    Adam and Eve’s growth as characters? Given the grand scheme of
    Salvation laid out in Book 12, was Adam and Eve’s Fall a good thing
    or a bad thing? Why? *

**3.4 Style Points** <span id="3.4"></span>

-   *Does Milton as a storyteller pull off his grand scheme or is it
    seriously flawed?*
