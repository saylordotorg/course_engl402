**Unit 2: Milton’s Short Poetry** <span id="2"></span> 
*Though best known for his epic poetry, Milton was a talented lyric poet
in his own right. He consciously opted to begin his career as a lyrical
poet and to reach toward the more grandiose epic genre later in life,
modeling himself after the classical poet Virgil.*  
  
 *In this section, we will explore a number of Milton’s shorter poems,
looking first at some of his earliest works in order to get a sense of
his preoccupations and stylistic idiosyncrasies. We will then examine
verses from his more mature years, tracing various elements that he
continued to play with over the course of his poetic career and
attending to the various influences from which he repeatedly drew.*
