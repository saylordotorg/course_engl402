**Unit 4: *Paradise Regained*** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will explore one of Milton’s very last works, his
brief epic* Paradise Regained*, which tells the story of Jesus’
temptation in the Desert, and the quest for knowledge of self and
self-purpose. As with the* Paradise Lost *unit, we will begin by placing
the work in dialogue with other texts and traditions from which Milton
drew. We will then trace a number of the work’s major concerns and
achievements.*
