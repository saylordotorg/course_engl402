**Unit 1: The Life and Times of John Milton** <span id="1"></span> 
*John Milton lived in a period of great religious turmoil, intellectual
and artistic exploration, and political change. He witnessed a series of
intense political and military conflicts pitting the Parliamentarians
against the Royalists, the execution of King Charles I, the institution
of a Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, and the restoration of the
monarchy in 1660 - not to mention a number of developments in the
relatively young Church of England. It is nearly impossible to read his
poetry without attending to this context, as he actively contributed to
lively debates on public affairs and frequently (urgently!) commented on
these situations in his literary work.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will contextualize Milton within these dramatic
times, stopping to review his core beliefs (as articulated through his
prose writings as well as his literary works) and introduce ourselves to
the breadth of his oeuvre. *
